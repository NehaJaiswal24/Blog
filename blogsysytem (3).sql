Do you agree with this statement? Does it relate anyhow to the theory of the exceptionalism of the US?\r\nDoes football culture praise self-sacrifice for the benefit of the team and playing despite severe pain? Do you think it gives the game the essence of unity and involvement?

Discuss touch football and flag football (or Canadian football). Are these games less fascinating? Should schools adopt them to prevent injuries of children?\r\nIs racism still present in football?
